## Note:
- Issue:  "Savings interest is calculated DAILY at 23:59:00 and added up to Savingâ€™s balance." => Any deposit/withdraw from 23:59:01 to 23:59:59 will not calculate savings interest.
- Because of the time limit, this project was not include: database migration, some perfomance(noted by a comment in source code), code check, unit test, automation test.
